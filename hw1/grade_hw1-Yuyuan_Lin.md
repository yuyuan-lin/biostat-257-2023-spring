### Overall Grade: 144/148

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

Yes

-   Is the final report in a human readable format html?

Yes

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (Jupyter Notebook or Quarto Markdown) for reproducibility?

Yes

-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

Yes

### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 71/75

- Q2 (15/15)


- Q3 (18/20)

Q3.3 Need to explicitly say that, with `Integer` input, the LLVM compiler is able to unroll the loop and simplify the expression into a two flop operation: `g(k) = 9765625k - 2441406`. But, with `Float64` input, the LLVM compiler only unrolls the loop but didn't simplify the expression. (-2)


- Q4 (13/15)

In Q4.3, need to explicitly mention catastrophic cancellation scenario 2. (-2)


- Q5 (20/20)

- Q6 (18/18)

- Q7 (10/10)

	    
### Usage of Git: 10/10

- Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

Yes

- Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 

Yes
          
- Is the hw submission tagged? 

Yes

- Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 

Yes
  
- Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. 

### Reproducibility: 10/10

- Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? 

Yes

- If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

N/A
